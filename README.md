NeonScript is a minimal, low-level scripting language designed for simplicity, speed, and direct control.
It is ideal for learning compiler/interpreter design, scripting environments, or embedding into C projects.

# Features:

Direct text output with PRINT <text>
Simple user input via INPUT <prompt>
Supports single-line comments using // <comment>
Easy to extend and modify in C
Designed for understanding low-level language implementation
NeonScript is interpreted by a lightweight C program, making it a great starting point for those interested in building their own scripting languages or exploring system-level scripting.

# Example
PRINT Welcome to NeonScript!
// This is a comment
INPUT Enter your name:
PRINT Thank you!
# Getting Started
Clone the repository
Compile the interpreter (gcc Main.c -o neonscript)
Run your NeonScript file (./neonscript myscript.neo)
